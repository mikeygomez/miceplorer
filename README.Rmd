# miceplorer

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of miceplorer is to help in cleaning and preprocessing the data. You should use this package, because it tests for a wide variety of potential errors including making sure that weight and outcome measurement data are all numeric, ensuring that column names are correct, ensuring that IDs for all mice are correct, and identifying potential outliers. This package seeks to be a robust and easy-to-use tool in addressing errors in your datasets. 

Additionally, you should use miceplorer, because it gives you flexibility in the way you want to clean your dataset. For a comprehensive clean, we have a function called clean_mouse_data that will clean all your tabs and calls individual functions for cleaning birth data, weight data, and outcome data. By breaking it up into different functions, you have autonomy over which tabs you  want to clean. Additionally, the cleaning functions for weight and outcome data are also broken up into the same functions - one to check for proper column names, one to check for correct IDs, and one to check for quantitative variables. These functions are also available to you to use. 

This package also fits a time-series model on the data to identify potential outliers or issues with data recording. You can do this by calling the identifyoutliers() function. This package will also check for mice that have had over a 20% reduction in weight from baseline and mark them for SACing. Both these functions take the data and make into a format where each column is a different ID and and each row is each date. The individual function, preprocessdata(), is also available to you. Lastly, for basic EDA, this package also lets you plot the data by treatment group using the plot_indmeasurement() function.

## Installation

You can install the development version of miceplorer by entering this into the console:

```{r, eval = F}
devtools::install_github("mikeygomez/miceplorer")
```

From there, to load the package in your current session, call:

```{r, eval = F}
library(miceplorer)
```


## Example

This is a basic example of how to clean your dataset.

The excel file is expected to contain three sheets:

1. The birth data sheet sheet should contain the following columns in that particular order: ID, Sex, Num, Treatment

2. The body weight data sheet sheet should contain the following columns in that particular order: ID, Body Weight 1, Date Body Weight 1, ..., Body Weight X, Date Body Weight X

3. The outcome data sheet sheet should contain the following columns in that particular order: ID, Outcome 1, Date Outcome 1, ..., Outcome X, Date Outcome X

```{r, eval = F}
library(miceplorer)

path <- "~/miceplorer/data-raw/mousedata.xlsx"
mousedata <- clean_mouse_data(path)
```

Here is how you can visualize interim results:

```{r, eval = F}
treatment_info <- create_treatment_info(mousedata[1])

plots <- plot_indmeasurement(mousedata[2], "Body Weight", treatment_info)
print(plots$treatment)
print(plots$placebo)
```
